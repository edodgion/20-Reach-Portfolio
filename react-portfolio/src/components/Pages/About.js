  //    How have you utilized your time in a world wide pandemic?  Are the projects you've been juggling still up in the air? 
  //    With the current state of the world I have left those projects up in the air and created a new path. I have been 
  //    fortunate enough to have seized the opportunity to be accepted into the coding bootcamp program through the University 
  //    of Denver.  Hello my name is Eric Dodgion, currently residing in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  I am a developer 
  //    strengthening my skills in front and back end web development. Throughout these next few months I'm very excited to 
  //    learn various skill sets so that I may hone them into something that will help me evolve into a flourishing developer 
  //    in the industry.  My goals are to find opportunities to work as a front end developer for a company that I can 
  //    personally get behind and support in all aspects.  As a passionate musician and lover of LOUD music, the possibility 
  //    of eventually collaborating with sound engineers to develop unique amp simulators is a main goal.
